# Mac-specific tools

Immediately after unzipping the CEPSparker folder, right-click 
'initialSetupConfigApp.command' and select 'Open' from the contextual 
menu. In the resulting dialog, allow the script to run.

After that, all of the scripts in this folder can be double-clicked in the Finder
to make them run. 

Use a text editor to inspect the .command files.
